What Is Supply Chain Management?


Supply chain management is the coordination of the elements, such as customers, vendors, and suppliers, in the supply chain. It starts with logistics, which is the complex operation involving many people, facilities, and suppliers. The next element is supply chain planning, which is looking at how to achieve the strategy. SAP is well suited to provide the information needed to make those decisions. Asset management includes the infrastructure needed to maintain the supply chain, such as buildings, warehouses, equipment, people, and inventory.

Procurement is the buying and selling of products, which is just one of the elements within supply chain management. Supply chain management is the oversight of materials, information, and finances as they move in a process from supplier to manufacturer to wholesaler to retailer to the final customer. It draws heavily from the areas of industrial engineering, systems engineering, operations management, logistics, information technology, marketing, and strives for an integrated approach. Supply chain management is also interconnected or interlinked networks, channels, and no businesses combined in the provisioning of products and services required by the end customer. The automotive industry is already in the planning stages of new models, so future models are already in the planning stages.

The supply chain management practice draws heavily from the areas of industrial engineering, systems engineering, operations management, logistics, information technology, marketing, and strives for an integrated approach. The goal of supply chain management is to increase productivity, efficiency, timeliness, and reduce the cost of rework. SAP is a company that provides the ability to communicate with vendors, suppliers, and customers in a way that helps to improve the passage of materials, supplies, and services. HANA is one of the main drivers of SAP's new HANA products due to its ability to look at data and communicate quickly with suppliers. Supply chain management is defined as the design, planning, execution, control, and monitoring of supply chain activities with the objective of creating net value, building a competitive infrastructure, leveraging worldwide logistics, synchronizing supply with demand, and measuring performance globally.

It is important for businesses to have a competitive infrastructure and be fast and nimble to market in order to weather challenges such as recent storms in Texas. Worldwide logistics is also important for global companies to be quick to market with their suppliers and customers. Supply chain management is an important part of supply chain management, which involves synchronizing supply with demand and measuring the performance globally. SAP provides integrated planning and execution of processes to optimize the flow of materials, information and financial capital, including demand planning, sourcing, production, inventory management and storage, transportation or logistics, and return for excess or defective products. For demand planning, SAP uses sales and operation planning, while for sourcing, it uses the MM module.

Production is managed within the PP module, inventory management and storage is within the inventory management and warehouse modules, and transportation and logistics is within SD. Finally, return for excess or defective products is managed within both cells, SD and MM. Supply chain management is an important part of any organization, and it is one of the first areas that can be seen how well they are doing. One example of this is when a purchasing manager had to order a palette of a work in process from Italy, fly it from Spain to North Carolina at a cost of $40,000. Another example is when a purchasing manager was fired because they had product coming from Malaysia.

The supply chain model includes supply chain strategy, logistics management, procurement, information management, the planning piece, the asset management, suppliers, manufacturers, warehouses, stores, and customers. The logistics management piece includes people, facilities, suppliers, and procurement. Information management, in this case, is SAP, which has all the modules that encompasses those areas that need to develop a supply chain. SAP is a forward-looking way to coordinate assets to optimize the delivery of goods and services and information. It involves key suppliers and manufacturers working together to facilitate the supply chain.

When working with vendors and suppliers, it's important to understand their roles and not have a supplier of a key part or product. Vendor programs should be given a well thought-out plan of future needs and warehouses should be located close to end customers. Customers must also understand their needs to plan for future requirements. SAP does not have a button to create a supply chain, but it has elements that are used in many of its transactions. Supply chain management is the active management of supply chain activities to maximize customer value and achieve a sustainable competitive advantage.

SAP is one of the elements of a well-run organization that allows for this. Gartner's supply chain top 20 for 2017 shows that companies such as Apple, Procter & Gamble, and Amazon have strong presences in the market, an ability to react to changes, and strong positioning in their area. The end result of having a good business strategy and a good supply chain strategy is maximizing customer value and having and maintaining a sustainable competitive advantage.





Why Should We Implement Supply Chain Management?


Supply chain management is a process used by companies to manage contractual obligations to ensure a continuous supply and avoid delivery disruptions. It seeks to strengthen relations with suppliers so that if there are any issues, they can be resolved quickly. SAP is an example of a supplier that is used to order materials, store materials, and produce materials. The main goal of supply chain management is to have a return on investment and meet customer requirements. Companies should have good relationships with their suppliers so that they have the products when they need them and can supply them to customers.

Additionally, supply chain management seeks to strengthen their relations with suppliers so that if there are any issues, they can be resolved quickly. Supply chain management is an important part of business, as it ensures that procurement happens through the right suppliers and reduced costs. It also helps to manage risk and compliance to abide by organizational and industry-specific regulations and agreements. Additionally, it is essential to establish a comprehensive supplier view and derive insightful procurement analytics in order to help suppliers manage their relationships with customers. Finally, larger companies often have criteria or checklists that their suppliers must meet in order to ensure that they are in good standing and can help with the ultimate goal of achieving return on investment.

Supply chain management is an important factor in increasing profit leverage and cash flow, as well as boosting customer service, reducing operating costs, and improving financial position. It is also essential to be a dependable supplier to customers, as customers now have many options in terms of who they work with. This is especially true for Amazon, which operates in a reliable and cost-efficient way of doing business. Supply chain management is essential to ensure that the right product is acquired at the right time, in order to boost customer service, reduce operating costs, and improve financial position. For layman, the why of supply chain management is to get the right product at the right time. Additionally, within an organization, there are their own reasons for why they need a supply chain, such as increasing profit leverage, increasing cash flow, achieving return on investment, providing good service to customers, reducing operating costs, and improving financial position.




SAP and Key Factors that Impact Supply Chain Management
Looking at Standard Areas of SAP Used in a Supply Chain


This document is a Michael' Management course on supply chain management and overview. The course aims to provide an understanding of supply chain management, one of the many models available, such as logistics, supply chain strategy, planning, asset management, procurement, and product lifecycle, and to offer ideas for maintaining or improving supply chains. SAP's ERP modules, including SD, MM, PP, customer service, QM, and PM, along with financial accounting, controlling, asset management, and treasury management, are used to build and improve supply chains. Material management and supply chain management are important aspects of SAP. Material management includes purchase requisitions, POs, and inventory management submodules.

For those who work with purchasing, it contains their purchase requisitions, POs, and inventory management submodules. The supply chain is comprised of this, as well as other aspects of the planning module. Within SAP, there are only a couple of modules that need to operate with, such as finance and purchasing function. Within materials manage, purchasing starts with purchasing, including materials and services and vendors. Material management is an essential part of supply chain management, which includes purchasing inventory management, sales and distribution, logistics execution, and production planning.

It is the core submodules of the materials management module that contains the components for supply chain functionality and SAP. Sales and operations planning, logistics execution, and production planning are all submodules of the materials management module that are essential for the success of a supply chain. In order to improve the supply chain, it is important to understand the material management module and its submodules, such as SD, logistics execution, and production planning. MRP (material requirements and replenishment planning) is a tool used by SAP to track inventory at a storage location level. Within inventory, the first thing to do is to take a look at stock levels.

This can be done within the inventory management module, environment, materials management, and environment submodules. Within supply chain, it is important to start with purchasing and vendors when evaluating stock levels. For buyers, it is necessary to have a good look at stock levels within the inventory management module. For those that don't know MRP, it is materials requirements and replenishment planning. Inventory management is an important part of the supply chain, and SAP's tool is not enough without the right people in place.

Sales and distribution (SD) is part of the logistics module that supports customers from quotations to building the customer. SD is used to build S&OP (Sales and Operations Planning) and shipping functionality. Logistics execution is part of the materials management module and involves warehousing operations. Warehouse management is used to maintain inventory at a bin level, but it can become unmanageable if not disciplined in the transactions. It is important to ensure that materials are transferred into and out of the locations properly.

Logistics execution and production planning are important components of the supply chain. Production planning aligns demand with manufacturing capacity and creates production and procurement schedules for finished product and component materials. It is a critical component for manufacturing within a company. The flow of information in terms of demand through the actual issuing of finished materials to the customer can be visualized using the master data system within SAP. Master data provides a baseline object for transacting and can be used to determine the flow of materials, vendors, and customers in the supply chain.

MRP is materials requirements planning and involves creating a purchase requisition to request the purchase of goods or services. Once approved, the purchase requisition is converted into a purchase order and transmitted to the vendor. The vendor then sends in the material and it is received into inventory. If the organization has warehouse management, they can bring the material in from inventory management and move it into a warehouse. The QM module and quality management are used to inspect the materials and release them into unrestricted use.

Finally, the outbound logistics process is used to ship the materials out. This is one of many ways that organizations can use modules within logistics to move their materials to their final customers.



Key Factors in Maintaining a Supply Chain

This course is built on the fact that if you have a SAP, you have the building blocks of either creating or maintaining a robust supply chain. Key factors in maintaining a supply chain in SAP are highlighted, such as having a faith in people and utilizing technology. Additionally, a quote from Steve Jobs states that technology is not enough without people. Additionally, prior to learning SAP, the speaker worked as a buyer for a tire company and built out their own supply chain, using carbon black as a component. SAP is a tool that helps businesses manage their supply chain by providing all the information in one location.

The key factors for success in a supply chain include people, processes, discipline, communication, and training. People should be given the authority to do their job, processes should be maintained, communication should be clear, and training should be provided to those who need it. These five characteristics should be implemented to ensure success in a supply chain. SAP is a great tool, but it requires the right personnel in the right position to be successful. In SAP, the receiving function is one of the key processes, and the right people need to be in position to do the job.

Additionally, processes are a series of actions or steps taken in order to achieve a particular end. These two key factors must be in place for any organization to successfully implement SAP. SAP is a structured process that requires consistency and data input, and the output is fairly consistent. In terms of supply chain management, vendors must fill and ship orders on time, production must follow the proper steps to meet the schedule, and shipping must follow the steps for getting the product out the door to the final customer. Discipline is another key factor for a supply chain, which could involve the sales organization not maintaining a close look at customer indicators, vendors not delivering on time, wrong product and quantity, purchasing not following up on internal signals of needs, receiving in warehouse and not performing transaction in a timely manner or not maintaining accurate records of internal movements.

SAP is a disciplined tool that can tell you if a transaction or input is right, but it won't tell you if the input is correct. Discipline in terms of transactions and purchasing is important to ensure that the expectations of results are consistent. Communication is also important, especially in supply chain management, where 60%-70% of revenues go to the cost of goods sold. Poor communication can negatively impact the supply chain. SAP is an important key factor in the supply chain, as it allows for communication between different elements impacted by the supply chain.

Communication is key in SAP, as it ensures that information is flowing throughout the organization and key people are aware of the impact of transactions. Training is another key factor, although sometimes the last to be planned due to budget restraints. This can lead to projects not being completed on time, which can have a negative impact on the business. SAP is a powerful software that requires a well-trained staff to be effective. Training can be either formal or informal and should be taken upstream and downstream of the project.

It is important to know the upstream and downstream processes, as well as those responsible for them. Training can be done informally or directly, with the goal of providing the most efficient manner of getting tasks completed. It is often overlooked because it is not easily measured in terms of responsibility. Overall, with SAP, it has a lot of value if utilized in the most efficient way, and training is one of the key things to have in place. SAP is a key factor to consider when implementing a new system, as it requires people to be part of the process and have buy-in.

To ensure success, consultants should reach out to the least receptive person in their course or class to show them the benefits of the process. Once they understand what's required, they can get the benefit they outlaid the money for.




How to Evaluate your Supply Chain

Supply chain management is essential for an organization to succeed, and SAP can help evaluate the supply chain. Informally, it can be done by walking to the warehouse and seeing too much inventory or getting a call from Production that an item is needed. In formal terms, it can be done through methods such as the Lean Supply Chain as found in the Scor model. Good companies know if their supply chain is adequate or not, and SAP can help measure this. SAP is a tool used to evaluate supply chain performance.

It looks at delivery reliability, responsiveness, flexibility, cost, and asset management. Delivery reliability measures how products are shipped in perfect condition and packaging with correct documentation. Response measures how quickly supply chain and logistics function can deliver products to the door. Six Sigma is a formal organization tasked with maintaining the supply chain. Flexibility measures the agility and response time when there are changes in supply chain.

Cost evaluation looks at the cost of good sold, total supply chain and logistic cost, transportation, and distribution costs. Asset management looks at how effectively a company manages assets to meet demand. SAP is a major player in the supply chain industry, and its performance can be evaluated through qualitative and quantitative measures. Qualitative measures focus on customer satisfaction and product quality, while quantitative measures look at order to delivery lead time, supply chain response time, flexibility, resource utilization, and delivery performance. KPIs are key performance indicators used to measure inventory, inventory turnover, days on hand, average inventory, service level, and inventory accuracy. SAP also provides Standard Reports, Standard and Flexible Analysis, which allow users to access the information they need to run their businesses better.
